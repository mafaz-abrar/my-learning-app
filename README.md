# my-learning-app

My second Kotlin app created for my 2022 Sem 2 Software Development for Mobile Devices unit for my Bachelor of Computer Science course at Swinburne University of Technology.

I learned about all the fundamental programming principles and artifacts as they apply in Kotlin, and also about some Kotlin-specific styles and techniques that make this language so easy to use.
